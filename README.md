- 👋 Hi, I’m @tanuafom
- 👀 I’m interested in productivity, learning, national security, existential risks, and puppies!
- 🌱 I’m currently (re-)learning linear algebra on my terms so that I can eventually learn data science.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that would help me practice my SQL and mathematical skills.
